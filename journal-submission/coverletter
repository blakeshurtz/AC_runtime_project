Hi, I have reviewed journals covering the topics in this research paper and I feel that this journal is a good fit, in particular, the special issue "Data-Driven Energy Modeling and Simulation Techniques for Smart Buildings". Why? My research is data-driven in that it is based on thousands of data points gathered using dataloggers. It also includes energy modeling in the form of cooling load calculations. It also includes simulation techniques in that it uses a statistical simulation to arrive at generalized results. Finally, as far as "smart buildings", smart buildings are typically designed to be energy-efficient and the crux of the argument in this paper is that homeowners and contractors are afraid to make trade-offs that would improve building energy efficiency/performance and that this needs to be accepted and explored.
